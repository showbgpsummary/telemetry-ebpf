# Developing my own telemetry services 
In this repository,I will code my own telemetry services via golang,code a little C for more low-level functions and dynamicly adapt current CPU and RAM stats of the host.

# Main Goal

Integrating my own telemetry services to linux core via ebpf,managing cpu priorities and detect possible OOMKILL's,saving as much logs as I can but never harm other services like FRR.
